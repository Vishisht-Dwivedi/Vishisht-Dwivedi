### 🧭 About Me

I'm a first-year CS student with a deep interest in software development, web technologies, and the problem-solving side of programming. I’m not trying to rush the journey — instead, I’m building my skills brick by brick, one real-world project at a time.

I care about performance, maintainability, and clean structure — not just “making it work.”
