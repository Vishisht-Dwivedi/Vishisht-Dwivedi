### 🧭 About Me

I'm a first-year CS student with a deep interest in software development, web technologies, and the problem-solving side of programming. I’m not trying to rush the journey — instead, I’m building my skills brick by brick, one real-world project at a time.

I care about performance, maintainability, and clean structure — not just “making it work.”

### 🚧 Featured Projects

#### 📝 [Diurnal Chronique](https://github.com/Vishisht-Dwivedi/diurnal-chronique)
> A minimal blog platform made for my college (IIIT Bhopal). It handles custom authentication, routing, and post management without relying on third-party services — with performance and clarity as top priorities.

#### 🧾 [College Timetable Generator](https://github.com/Vishisht-Dwivedi/college-timetable-generator)
> Generates clean, day-wise schedules for teachers by aggregating data across multiple classrooms. Built with code simplicity and reliability in mind.

#### 🎳 [Physics Ball Simulation](https://github.com/Vishisht-Dwivedi/physics-ball-simulation)
> A fully interactive canvas-based physics simulation that features real-time motion, collisions, and boundary checks. No libraries — just pure logic and math.
